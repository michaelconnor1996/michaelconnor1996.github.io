All of the code samples are from my Megaman fan clone project.

AnimationGenerator: Contains some utility functions for creating animations, 

BattleController: This class controls the flow of battle. It is responsible for successfully starting battles, and based on events that it receives, also for ending the battle.

BattlefieldProvider: Randomly (with area constraints) selects and builds a battlefield 'map' by parsing an XML file.
